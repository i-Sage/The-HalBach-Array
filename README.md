## Overview

This project presents a 2D magnetostatic simulation study conducted in FEMM to compare the spatial flux density characteristics of a uniformly magnetized permanent magnet array versus a Halbach array configuration. The objective is to quantify and visualize how field shaping impacts usable magnetic flux at varying distances from the source.

Simulation Setup
The simulations were performed in FEMM using a 2D planar magnetostatic model. Two configurations were analyzed:

Uniform Magnetization Array
All magnetic segments are magnetized in a single, consistent direction.
Halbach Array
A periodic magnetization pattern is used to reinforce the magnetic field on one side while cancelling it on the opposite side.

Both geometries were constructed with identical material properties, magnet dimensions, and spatial periodicity to ensure fair comparison.

Measurement Method
Flux density (|B|) was sampled at three vertical distances above the magnet surface:

- 0.01 mm
- 1 mm
- 10 mm

These probe points were used to evaluate near-field and far-field behavior of both configurations.

## Key Outputs

Magnetic flux density distribution plots for both configurations
Comparative field decay curves with height
Quantitative comparison of field focusing efficiency

## Expected Physical Behavior

Uniform magnetization: symmetric field distribution with rapid lateral spreading
Halbach array: field concentration on one side with improved surface-normal flux density and reduced leakage field
Increased divergence in performance becomes more pronounced with distance

### Tools Used

- FEMM (Finite Element Method Magnetics)
- Post-processing in Python

### Key Insight

The Halbach configuration demonstrates improved field localization and higher usable flux density at equivalent distances above the array, particularly in the near-field region. The uniform array exhibits faster spatial decay due to symmetric field cancellation effects.

### Future Work

Extend analysis to 3D models
Evaluate optimization of magnet segmentation angle
